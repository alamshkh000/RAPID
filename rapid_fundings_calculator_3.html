1
How AWS is increasing investment into the AWS Distribution Program

The enhancements to RAPID

Overview of RAPID and benefits

Call to Action
Introduction
3
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is enhancing support for partners looking to resell AWS services and expand their business models through AWS Distributors. 

We’re investing in scaling partner support via Distributors to better equip them with enablement, go-to-market resources, and training—boosting AWS engagement and expanding customer reach through AWS Marketplace. 


RAPID
The number of partners engaged with AWS Distributors has doubled YoY (from 3,200 in January 2023 to 6,700+ till date).
The number of customers that Distributors are selling to has also grown exponentially, doubling YoY.
Our data shows that partners working with authorized AWS Distributors see up to 114% YoY increase in revenue, and 392% increase in opportunity launches.
Partners can reduce their time-to-first-sale by up to 50%, from an average of 7 months to 3 months.

To help new and existing partners capitalize on this opportunity and expand their customer footprint, AWS is investing in its Distribution channel as a key route to market for both commercial and public sector partners.

5
AWS stands out in the industry by providing a comprehensive business development framework through its Distribution channel, which is uniquely designed to accelerate partner capabilities, reduce time-to-market, and drive mutual business outcomes.
RAPID in 2025 
6
RAPID is a sector-agnostic program that integrates the two previously separate programs, and:
Includes financial incentives throughout the partner lifecycle
Rewards authorized distributors for both development of strategic partners, and activation of new transacting partners and MRR growth
Provides a clear roadmap of activities, performance milestones and financial incentives
Results in decreased effort for Distributors through AWS structured guidance and automated processes
Leverages a proven, repeatable framework to develop all AWS Partners
Current State
Future State
Two separate programs:
RAPID Program for all Partners
DLAD Program for Public Sector Partners 
RAPID in 2025 
7
Beginning January 1, 2025, there will be enhancements to RAPID:

Program integration and simplification: Distribution-Led Accelerated Development (DLAD) will integrate with RAPID.

RAPID will expand to include three motions: 
RAPID GTM Ready (formerly DLAD; for authorized AWS Distributors only)
RAPID Activate (formerly Reseller Growth Motion) 
RAPID Grow (formerly RGM Accelerators)

RAPID GTM Ready will be available to all Distribution Sellers (Commercial Sector and Public Sector). 
Note: there may be additional considerations for AWS Distributors with RAPID GTM Ready in a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA)



Distributor Benefits
8
In 2025, we’re enhancing and streamlining RAPID for AWS Distributors to include three motions: 

RAPID GTM Ready (formerly DLAD)
RAPID Activate (formerly Reseller Growth Motion)
RAPID Grow (formerly RGM Accelerators)


The maximum a distributor can earn across all three motions is $63k per Distributor Seller, which consists of:

$30k maximum incentive for RAPID GTM Ready + 
$25k maximum for RAPID Activate + 
$8k for RAPID Grow* 
= $63k total per distribution seller

*For RAPID Grow, the maximum incentive is $8k because the distributor would have already been paid for the PSF listing during the RAPID GTM Ready motion 





RAPID GTM Ready (formerly DLAD)
9
Distributors will lead partners through the AWS Partner Development Framework.



Partners will "graduate" after completing several milestones, including:

APN Enablement (e.g., ACE workshops, Partner Solution Finder listing)
Technical Validation (SO FTR/FTR), and 
GTM Readiness (e.g., developing a Joint Marketing Plan). 
Distributors can earn up to $30k per partner who successfully completes the framework.

11
RAPID Activate (formerly Reseller Growth Motion)
12
Distributors can earn up to $25k per partner as they achieve MRR and transacting customer milestones. 
RAPID Grow (formerly RGM Accelerators)
13
Distributors can earn up to $10k per partner by helping them grow and mature their AWS practice, achieve AWS Specialization/Advanced Tier and/or Partner Solutions Finder listing. 

14
The distributor continues to support and grow Partner A and unlocks incentives for RAPID Grow accomplishments 
(for example Advanced Tier and AWS Specialization up to $8k).
Example Scenario 1 – All three RAPID Motions
Partner A chooses a distributor and signs a DSA. 
Partner A is a Registered Services Partner wanting to develop their AWS practice. How will the distributor unlock the RAPID incentives?

2
3
4
6
Once Partner A has graduated the RAPID GTM Ready motion, the distributor is paid 
(up to $30k). 
The distributor moves Partner A through the RAPID GTM Ready motion. 
As Partner A meets the customer and MRR thresholds, the distributor unlocks incentives 
(up to $25k). 
RAPID Activate applies by default.

15
Example Scenario 2 – Without RAPID GTM Ready
Partner A chooses a distributor and signs a DSA. 
Partner A is a Registered Services Partner wanting to develop their AWS practice. How will the distributor unlock the RAPID incentives? 
1
2
3
4
The distributor supports and grows Partner A and unlocks incentives for RAPID Grow accomplishments 
(for example PSF, Advanced Tier and AWS Specialization up to $10k).
 
The distributor determines Partner A is not suitable for the RAPID GTM Ready motion. 
As Partner A meets the customer and MRR thresholds, the distributor unlocks incentives 
(up to $25k). 
RAPID Activate applies by default.

Calls To Action
Maximize Distributors’ RAPID earning and drive high AWS revenue growth at scale
Develop partners into transacting and technically capable to provide customer solutions 
Invest in recruiting new partners from your base of non-AWS partners and stagnant AWS partners with DSA

Partner name: XQ
Use case: RAPID GTM Ready motion
Success Story: Software Partner 
SITUATION
TASK
ACTION
RESULT
XQ (Software Partner) was an early-stage ISV that was not getting traction in their AWS Partner Journey and were lost in the APN process, not receiving any attention from AWS and were not GTM ready.
Distributor worked with XQ to develop them, leveraging RAPID GTM Ready motion.
Distributor guided XQ through Rapid GTM milestone requirements and graduated the partner co-sell ready, ISV-A and listed in Marketplace.
XQ is a validated AWS Software partner that offers a Zero Trust solution for customers globally. XQ is now recognized as 1 of 6 AWS customer recommended solutions for Zero Trust. Distributor is continuing to differentiate XQ and IS pursuing their Security Competency, leveraging the RAPID Grow incentives.  

19
Partner name: EDT Partners
Use case: RAPID GTM Ready motion
Success Story: Services Partner 
SITUATION
TASK
ACTION
RESULT
EDT Partners was a Education-focused consulting firm that faced challenges in integrating and implementing learning solutions due to lack of specialized knowledge, support and functionality in cloud.
The Distributor, in collaboration with EDT Partners, created a path to success utilizing the RAPID GTM Ready framework that incorporated short and long term partnership goals.
Distributor worked with EDT Partners on RAPID GTM Ready motion and completed all actions required to Graduate EDT Partners as an Advanced Tier Partner and a differentiated partner designation.
EDT Partners is now an Advanced Tier Public Sector Partner, has achieved an Education Consulting Competency with their “EdOps Framework” and has become a proficient AWS Services partner with 22 launched opportunities and over $11 million in revenue.

20
By working with a Distributor, partners gain access to specialized training, technical resources, and go-to-market support. This empowers partners to rapidly build their AWS selling and implementation capabilities. Partners can reduce their time-to-first-sale by up to 50%, from an average of 7 months to 3 months.</div>
